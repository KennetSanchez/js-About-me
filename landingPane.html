      <h3>Hi, my name is Kennet Santiago S치nchez Rold치n</h3>
      <p>
        I am 18 years old, I am a software engineering student and I am
        currently in the fourth semester. I have varied interests, but systems
        and the search for solutions to everyday problems are the ones I like to
        dedicate the most time to. Although I feel more comfortable with the
        back-end as they are the technologies my university focuses on, I am
        very interested in the front-end, and I try to learn it on my own.

            I studied my baccalaureate in a commercial college, where I learned
            the fundamentals of accounting for small and medium-sized companies,
            bases of their taxation, basic payroll management, Excel management,
            English focused on business, and I studied entrepreneurship courses
            where we had as final evaluation the exposition of our project at an
            entrepreneurship fair open to the entire municipality.

            I studied a technical course in accounting for business and
            financial operations. I strengthened my knowledge based on
            accounting for small and medium-sized companies, acquired new
            knowledge about the management of employee payroll, improved my
            handling of Excel, and got a certificate that allows me to work as
            an assistant in accounting areas organizations.

            I have attended three semesters, and the university has helped me to
            learn new programming languages, understand the process of searching
            for solutions and evaluating them to optimally implement them,
            improve my skills, participate in extracurricular clubs, and improve
            my social skills.
