      <h3>Hi, my name is Kennet Santiago Sánchez Roldán</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        I am 18 years old, I am a software engineering student and I am
        currently in the fourth semester. I have varied interests, but systems
        and the search for solutions to everyday problems are the ones I like to
        dedicate the most time to. Although I feel more comfortable with the
        back-end as they are the technologies my university focuses on, I am
        very interested in the front-end, and I try to learn it on my own.

            I studied my baccalaureate in a commercial college, where I learned
            the fundamentals of accounting for small and medium-sized companies,
            bases of their taxation, basic payroll management, Excel management,
            English focused on business, and I studied entrepreneurship courses
            where we had as final evaluation the exposition of our project at an
            entrepreneurship fair open to the entire municipality.

            I studied a technical course in accounting for business and
            financial operations. I strengthened my knowledge based on
            accounting for small and medium-sized companies, acquired new
            knowledge about the management of employee payroll, improved my
            handling of Excel, and got a certificate that allows me to work as
            an assistant in accounting areas organizations.

          <p>
            <br />
            I have attended three semesters, and the university has helped me to
            learn new programming languages, understand the process of searching
            for solutions and evaluating them to optimally implement them,
            improve my skills, participate in extracurricular clubs, and improve
            my social skills.

          <h4>VIP</h4>
          <p>
            <br />
            In this club I learned how to use Python, we learned to code as a
            team with people from other careers, and other semesters. I was in
            the development team of a KNN algorithm implemented in Python, we
            plan to include our algorithm on the club's website so that anyone
            interested can learn and see how this type of algorithm works.

          <h4>Web development basics</h4>
          <p>
            <br />
            In this course I learned how to handle my HTML pages with unique
            identifiers and classes to style them with CSS, and how to connect
            the pages with the scripts in JavaScript. We also learned how to use
            Font-awesome icons, Google fonts, and the Bootstrap framework, as
            well as the bases of web development.
          </p>

          <h4>Git and GitHub Basics</h4>
          <p>
            <br />
            In this course, we learned how to use GitHub to work as a team, to
            return to previous versions of the program, correct errors with the
            merge, force changes in the repository history, as well as good
            practices to separate the development of the program into branches
            so that each member can work without being affected by bugs in the
            code of their teammates

          <h4>Linux: installation and basic operation</h4>
          <p>
            <br />
            In this course, we learned how to install Fedora (Linux), manage
            users, groups, permissions, and restrict access to the superuser. We
            also learned to create a private network so that our colleagues
            could view our pages, access our files remotely, among other things.

            is a software developed in java and javafx, for the “Centro de
            educación individualizada”, a small school in the city of Cali. This
            software is designed to facilitate the recording, editing, and
            management of basic information about students. The program
            calculates how much students must pay based on the information
            provided, allows updating this data, and registering whether or not
            a student owes money.
